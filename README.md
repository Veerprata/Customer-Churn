# Customer-Churn

This study delves into the pivotal realm of Customer Churn Prediction, addressing the critical challenge of customer attrition within the telecommunications industry. Employing advanced machine learning methodologies, our project is dedicated to developing a predictive model designed to discern customers at risk of discontinuing their services. The comprehensive approach encompasses meticulous data preprocessing, including the handling of categorical variables and feature scaling, followed by the application of a Random Forest Classifier and many other Classifiers.
 
Through rigorous analysis, our model not only showcases commendable predictive accuracy but also unravels intricate insights into the diverse factors influencing customer churn. By interpreting these patterns, our study empowers telecom operators with actionable intelligence, enabling them to proactively implement targeted retention strategies. This work contributes not only to the evolution of data-driven decision-making within the telecommunications sector but also provides a robust framework for addressing customer attrition challenges across various industries.
